## ⚡ Problem

When a typhoon or natural disaster hits the Philippines, small-scale farmers often lose their entire livelihood in hours. Traditional government or NGO relief funds typically take **2 to 4 weeks** to reach them due to manual verification, bank processing delays, and logistical friction. For a farmer in provinces like Rizal or Central Luzon, this delay leads to a cycle of debt.

## 🛡️ Solution

AgriStream uses **Soroban Smart Contracts** to bypass traditional financial red tape. NGO administrators can pre-fund an escrow contract. When a disaster is declared, the NGO allocates specific amounts of USDC to registered farmers' Stellar addresses instantly. 

* **Funds are instant:** No waiting for bank clearing or manual wire transfers.
* **Escrow Security:** Funds are locked on-chain and can only be claimed by the verified beneficiary.
* **Cost Effective:** Transaction fees are less than PHP 0.50 ($0.01), ensuring nearly 100% of the aid reaches the farmer.

## 🌟 Stellar Features Used

| Feature | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Soroban Smart Contracts** | Implements core `allocate` and `claim` logic for secure, programmed aid. |
| **USDC on Stellar** | Utilized as the primary settlement asset to provide price stability for farmers. |
| **Deterministic Addressing** | Maps unique allocations to Farmer Public Keys to ensure funds reach the intended recipient. |
| **On-Chain Audit Trail** | Every disbursement creates an immutable record on the Stellar ledger for transparency. |

## 📜 Smart Contract Functions

The AgriStream logic is written in Rust and deployed as a Soroban smart contract.

| Function | Caller | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `allocate(admin, farmer, amount)` | **NGO Admin** | Authorizes and locks USDC in escrow for a specific farmer's address. |
| `claim(farmer)` | **Farmer** | Transfers the locked relief funds from the contract to the farmer's wallet. |
| `get_allocation(farmer)` | **Anyone** | Read-only check to see the pending relief balance for a specific farmer. |

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Smart Contract
```bash
# Build the contract
stellar contract build

# Optimize for deployment
stellar contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/agri_stream.wasm
2. Frontend
Bash
# Navigate to project root
cd ayudastream-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development server
npm run dev
```

### System Architecture


```bash
Browser (React + Vite + TypeScript)
|-- Freighter Wallet API      (NGO Authentication & Signing)
|-- @stellar/freighter-api    (Wallet Connection)
|-- Soroban RPC               (On-chain State Interaction)

Stellar Testnet
|-- AgriStream Smart Contract (Escrow & Allocation Logic)
|-- USDC Token Contract       (Asset for disbursement)
No traditional database is used for the core ledger. All relief allocations and disbursement states live natively on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring a transparent and tamper-proof audit trail for donors.
