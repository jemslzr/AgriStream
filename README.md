# 🌾 AgriStream

Immediate disaster relief disbursement for Filipino farmers, built on Stellar Soroban.

---

## ⚡ Problem

When a typhoon or natural disaster hits the Philippines, small-scale farmers often lose their entire livelihood in hours. Traditional government or NGO relief funds typically take **2 to 4 weeks** to reach them due to manual verification, bank processing delays, and logistical friction. For a farmer in provinces like Rizal or Central Luzon, this delay leads to a cycle of debt.

## 🛡️ Solution

AgriStream uses **Soroban Smart Contracts** to bypass traditional financial red tape. NGO administrators can pre-fund an escrow contract. When a disaster is declared, the NGO allocates specific amounts of USDC to registered farmers' Stellar addresses instantly. 

* **Funds are instant:** No waiting for bank clearing or manual wire transfers.
* **Escrow Security:** Funds are locked on-chain and can only be claimed by the verified beneficiary.
* **Cost Effective:** Transaction fees are less than PHP 0.50 ($0.01), ensuring nearly 100% of the aid reaches the farmer.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Browser (React + Vite + TypeScript)
|-- Freighter Wallet API      (NGO Authentication & Signing)
|-- @stellar/freighter-api    (Wallet Connection)
|-- Soroban RPC               (On-chain State Interaction)

Stellar Testnet
|-- AgriStream Smart Contract (Escrow & Allocation Logic)
|-- USDC Token Contract       (Asset for disbursement)


No traditional database is used for the core ledger. All relief allocations and disbursement states live natively on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring a transparent and tamper-proof audit trail for donors.

## 📜 Smart Contract

The AgriStream logic is written in Rust and deployed as a Soroban smart contract. It has been optimized for the Stellar Testnet to ensure minimal gas consumption and maximum execution efficiency.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Smart Contract
The contract must be optimized before deployment to ensure compatibility with Soroban's WASM limits.
```bash
# Build the contract
stellar contract build

# Optimize for deployment
stellar contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/agri_stream.wasm
2. Frontend
Bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.

🎯 Target Users
Filipino Farmers: Rural small-scale agriculturists needing immediate liquidity post-calamity.

NGOs & LGUs: Relief organizations seeking a transparent, auditable, and rapid way to distribute aid without traditional banking friction.
